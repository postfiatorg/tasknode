Please complete each of the following 8 steps with MASSIVE ATTENTION TO DETAIL  

Pay special attention to the flow of tasks. They start with proposals, then go to acceptance, then initial verification, final 
verification and then reward. Task IDs are passed through this process, so there may appear to be multiple duplicate tasks
and you should pay special attention to understand that this may be due to the task appearing in different states.

1. Create a rank ordered list of all the user's outstanding tasks (both accepted and outstanding) Sorted by importance with a comment on 
how long they have been outstanding. The current date is {datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}. Do not omit tasks from this list 
write 2-3 sentences about what the user's focus is and why that is likely the case 
2. Create a description of why the user has been refusing tasks as well as what type of tasks have been refused. Make a List of the top 10
most recent relevant refusals. 
Write 2-3 sentences about the types of tasks that the user is refusing so that these tasks can be avoided in terms of generation if possible 
Don't just focus on why the user is refusing but enumerate the specific tasks being refused and the context of those tasks 
3. Describe what tasks are in the User's Verification Cue
4. Looking at the User's reward cue - list out all the relevant projects the user has been working on as well as the recent rewards
and patterns in the user task completion feedback. The goal is to succinctly identify what the user has done 
Write 2-3 sentences about what the user has accomplished lately and therefore what they value 
5. Read the entirety of the user's context document and
a. State the User's high order Long Term objective - their north star
b. State the User's strategy towards reaching their long term objective
c. State the Tactics the user has identified clearly. Identify these in the style of a burn down list with bullets 
d. Identify any P0s the User Has Identified in their context document or emergencies that require immediate attention
e. STATE IN PLAIN ENGLISH WHAT THE USER IS DOING. WHAT ARE THEY TRYING TO ACHIEVE. HOW ARE THEY PLANNING TO DO IT.
DO NOT ASSUME THE READER HAS ACCESS TO THE CONTEXT DOCUMENT 
If the user has not identified these three things state that clearly 
6. Summarize the context document insofar as it is not capturing Long Term Objectives, Strategy or tactics along with the
Users input provided in User Context. Explicitly state what the users intent or state is as deduced from the USER REQUEST
message.
7. Write a brief 3 paragraph essay that includes:

Paragraph 1: ENSURING FOCUS
What set of tasks would lower the user's switching costs and keep them focused?
What set of tasks would drive the user's progress towards their goals most effective?
Has the user planned logically and does the context document contain enough info to make meaningfully good task output

Paragraph 2: ENSURING USER RESPECT
What patterns of refusals are there that need to be respected?
What P0s or emergencies has the user identified? that require an immediate change in focus
and articulate how this needs to happen. DOUBLE CHECK THE USER CONTEXT TO ENSURE

Paragraph 3:
Barring any P0s what does the user need to do in order to maximize their economic value generation.
If there are P0s how should focus be changed to address them

8. Identify reasoning for what task would add the most value to the user in terms of:
a. Driving them towards their stated Tactics, Strategy, or Long Term Objective
b. Not distracting them from their current context
c. Respecting their refusals, and not instructing them to complete things they've already done 
d. Being highly specific - such that it could be completed according to scope
e. not taking more than 3-4 hours - so it should be sufficiently chunked down. 
f. Not contradict with the explicit user request if the uesr is asking to work on a specific workflow 
g. Not overlap with an existing task they have accepted or have in verification
h. Have an economically useful output that is verifiable by a 3rd party if need be 
i. Fully incorporates emergencies or P0s outlined in either the document or logs

PROPOSED PF RULES - the following are guidelines to the PROPOSED PF block outlined below (delineated in pipes
per the final formatting rules)
1. Do not tell the user how long to spend on the task
2. Ensure it is scoped correctly
3. Ensure it is verifiable and isn't just writing information down but results in a consumable deliverable
4. Ensure it is economically valuable and not something that would be completable by a simple google search or chatgpt query (actually get
something done not just return info/text)
5. Do not assume the user has read any of the above or has context. capture the essence 
6. Do not restate the rules in the actual proposed pf. Simply provide the task - clearly and its reasoning that should motivate the user
without pointlessly rattling off rules
7. Motivation should be delivered effectively, linking to the user's stated goals / long term objectives rather than alignment with
task requirements or rules. You do not need to say you are motivating the user - just do it 
8. The task should be in plain English and not use technical jargon 

After completing these 8 steps exactly output the following formatted string. End the string with a pipe and do not elaborate after that. The 
example below is the EXACT FORMAT YOU SHOULD USE WITHOUT DEVIATION 
<completed 8 steps clearly enumerated - include the text>

| PROPOSED PF | <Address the user directly in an imperative format referencing the Proposed PF Rules (do not restate them). 
First state the specific task identified in step 8 in 1-2 sentences. Then provide 1-2 sentences justifying the task per the above context> |
